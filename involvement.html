                <h3>Alpha Phi Omega Service Fraternity</h3>
                <p>January 2023 - Present</p>
                <p>Alpha Phi Omega (APO) is the nation's largest co-ed 
                    service fraternity. Our goal is to provide service to 
                    our campus, community, fraternity, and nation while 
                    exemplifying our cardinal principles of leadership, 
                    friendship, and service. Since being initiated in
                    January of 2023, I have accumulated over 180 hours of service.
                </p>
                <p>As a brother in APO, I was elected to be the Spirit 
                    Chair for the Fall 2023 semester. With this, I 
                    gathered and shared positive news and significant 
                    feats of leadership, friendship, and service from 
                    both brothers and pledges to be shared with the 
                    chapter; I announced the news and upcoming birthdays                         to the chapter; and I planned and hosted Spirit Week, 
                    giving the brothers a chance to participate in fun 
                    and meaningful activities while becoming closer as 
                    brothers.
                </p>
                <p>I had the privilege of serving as an Assistant to the 
                    Fellowship Vice President for the Spring 2024 semester. 
                    In this role, I assisted the Fellowship VP in planning 
                    and hosting fellowship events, allowing brothers to 
                    grow closer as a chapter; I assisted in planning the 
                    end-of-semester formal, an event to welcome the new 
                    brothers to the chapter.

                        On this same trip, we had the opportunity to work with a local food bank that
                        partners with Feeding America. We helped restock items in the store room, as
                        well as sorting through items that had been recently donated.
